# Write2Text
This project is designed to take handwritten text and convert it to printed text. First, the code reads the text and divides it into separate words as components, then passes a list of separately selected words to the recognition model. The ml/inbox stores code for training and inferencing machine learning models, as well as data and notebooks for experimentation. The backend/ folder contains the API for FastAPI, which accepts images and returns results. The frontend will implement an interface for uploading images and displaying text. The tests/ folder contains tests to verify that the project components are working.
